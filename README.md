# Weather_Dashboard

For this assignment we were tasked with inputing a city name and having the weather from that city generate  as well as a five day forecast for that city.  I found this to be immensely challenging .  I laid out front page with bootstrap and then used Jquery to create the script for the city input, the display of the weather, and for creating new items down below for the 5 day forecast.
